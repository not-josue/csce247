Java Design Patterns are tried-and-true templates that simplify problem-solving in software development. 
They're used across countless Java applications to make code more reliable and easier to extend.

**Why it matters:** Java Design Patterns are proven, reusable solutions that make code cleaner, more efficient, and easier to maintain.

**The big picture:** They're the backbone of many Java applications, helping developers solve common problems with consistency and speed.

**What this website is:** A simple way to see how design patterns can be learned — and applied — through the example of an escape room game.

**What this website isn't:** A copy-and-paste solution. The content was generated with ChatGPT-5, so it's meant for learning and inspiration, not production-ready code.

**In practice:** The examples center on an escape room game, showing how each pattern plays out in practice. Use them as inspiration when designing your own game — or any project that needs clear, flexible code.
