<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Strategy Design Pattern" icon="seti:notebook">
		Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and lets you swap them at runtime without changing the client code.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Observer Design Pattern" icon="magnifier">
		Establishes a one-to-many dependency so when one object's state changes, all its dependents are automatically notified and updated.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Decorator Design Pattern" icon="seti:stylelint">
		Dynamically adds new behaviors or responsibilities to objects without altering their underlying structure.
	</Card>
	<Card title="State Design Pattern" icon="homebrew">
		Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if it has switched class.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Factory Design Pattern" icon="seti:bicep">
		Provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete implementation.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Singleton Design Pattern" icon="laptop">
		Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Facade Design Pattern" icon="seti:ignored">
		Offers a simplified, unified interface to a complex subsystem, hiding its internal details.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Iterator Design Pattern" icon="random">
		Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Command Design Pattern" icon="comment">
		Encapsulates a request as an object, letting you parameterize actions, queue them, and support undo/redo.
	</Card>
