title: ðŸŽ­ Facade Design Pattern
description: Learn about the Facade Design Pattern, its benefits, and how to implement it in your code.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The **Facade Pattern** is a **structural design pattern** that:

- Provides a **simplified interface** to a complex subsystem.
    
- Makes the system easier to use without exposing all the details.
    
<Aside type="caution" title='Key Idea' icon="star">
  Think of it like a **front desk clerk at a hotel**: instead of talking to housekeeping, kitchen, and maintenance directly, you just talk to the clerk, and they coordinate everything.

## Escape Room Example Scenario

Your game might have subsystems like:

- **PuzzleSystem** â†’ handles puzzles.
    
- **ItemSystem** â†’ manages inventory.
    
- **SoundSystem** â†’ plays sound effects.
    
- **LightingSystem** â†’ controls room lights.
    
<Aside type="caution" title='Key Idea' icon="star">
  A player just wants to **start a room** or **solve a puzzle**, not micromanage all subsystems. Thatâ€™s where a **Facade** comes in.
</Aside>

## Subsystems

```java
// Puzzle system
public class PuzzleSystem {
    public void loadPuzzles() {
        System.out.println("Puzzles loaded.");
    }
    public void solvePuzzle() {
        System.out.println("Puzzle solved!");
    }
}

// Item system
public class ItemSystem {
    public void loadItems() {
        System.out.println("Items placed in the room.");
    }
    public void collectItem(String item) {
        System.out.println("Collected: " + item);
    }
}

// Sound system
public class SoundSystem {
    public void playBackgroundMusic() {
        System.out.println("Background music playing...");
    }
    public void playVictorySound() {
        System.out.println("Victory sound plays!");
    }
}

// Lighting system
public class LightingSystem {
    public void turnOnLights() {
        System.out.println("Lights are on.");
    }
    public void dimLights() {
        System.out.println("Lights dimmed for suspense...");
    }
}
```

## The Facade

```java
public class EscapeRoomFacade {
    private PuzzleSystem puzzleSystem;
    private ItemSystem itemSystem;
    private SoundSystem soundSystem;
    private LightingSystem lightingSystem;

    public EscapeRoomFacade() {
        this.puzzleSystem = new PuzzleSystem();
        this.itemSystem = new ItemSystem();
        this.soundSystem = new SoundSystem();
        this.lightingSystem = new LightingSystem();
    }

    // Start the escape room
    public void startGame() {
        puzzleSystem.loadPuzzles();
        itemSystem.loadItems();
        soundSystem.playBackgroundMusic();
        lightingSystem.turnOnLights();
        System.out.println("Escape room started!");
    }

    // Solve a puzzle
    public void solvePuzzle() {
        puzzleSystem.solvePuzzle();
        soundSystem.playVictorySound();
        lightingSystem.dimLights();
        System.out.println("Puzzle sequence complete.");
    }

    // Collect an item
    public void collectItem(String item) {
        itemSystem.collectItem(item);
    }
}
```

---

## Using the Facade

```java
public class EscapeRoomGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EscapeRoomFacade escapeRoom = new EscapeRoomFacade();

        // Player starts the game
        escapeRoom.startGame();

        // Player collects an item
        escapeRoom.collectItem("Flashlight");

        // Player solves a puzzle
        escapeRoom.solvePuzzle();
    }
}
```

---

## Sample Output

```
Puzzles loaded.
Items placed in the room.
Background music playing...
Lights are on.
Escape room started!
Collected: Flashlight
Puzzle solved!
Victory sound plays!
Lights dimmed for suspense...
Puzzle sequence complete.
```

---

## Why is Facade Useful in a Game?

- **Simplifies usage** â†’ Player just calls `startGame()` instead of juggling 4 subsystems.
    
- **Encapsulation** â†’ Subsystems can change internally without affecting the main game logic.
    
- **Readability** â†’ Your main game loop stays clean and easy to follow.
    

---

## Next Step Ideas ðŸ’¡

- Add a **endGame()** method that shuts everything down (lights off, stop music, display results).
    
- Have different facades for different **room themes** (HauntedRoomFacade, VaultRoomFacade).
    
- Combine with **Factory Pattern** to generate facades dynamically based on room type.

âœ… **Key Takeaway:**  
The **Facade Pattern** gives your escape room players (and your code) a **simple entry point** to a complex system, making the game much easier to manage and extend.
