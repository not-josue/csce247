title: 🎭 Facade With 🧑‍💻 Singleton Managers Example
description: An example of using the Facade pattern with manager classes to simplify complex subsystems.
---

**Facade in action:** Escape rooms have lots of moving parts — music, sound effects, items, characters. Managing each system directly clutters your code.

**Why it matters:** By making each manager a Singleton and wrapping them in a Facade, the game gets one simple interface. That means organized systems, cleaner code, and easy extensions down the road.

## Concept

- Each **Manager** (music, sounds, characters, items) is a **Singleton** → only one exists.
    
- A **Facade** provides a simple interface to interact with all of them.
    
- The game doesn’t need to know about each manager — just calls the **Facade**.

## MusicManager (Singleton)

```java
public class MusicManager {
    private static MusicManager instance;
    private MusicManager() {}

    public static MusicManager getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new MusicManager();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public void playBackgroundTrack(String track) {
        System.out.println("🎵 Playing background music: " + track);
    }

    public void stopMusic() {
        System.out.println("🛑 Music stopped.");
    }
}
```

---

## SoundEffectManager (Singleton)

```java
public class SoundEffectManager {
    private static SoundEffectManager instance;
    private SoundEffectManager() {}

    public static SoundEffectManager getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new SoundEffectManager();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public void playEffect(String effect) {
        System.out.println("🔊 Playing sound effect: " + effect);
    }
}
```

---

## CharacterManager (Singleton)

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class CharacterManager {
    private static CharacterManager instance;
    private List<String> characters = new ArrayList<>();

    private CharacterManager() {}

    public static CharacterManager getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new CharacterManager();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public void addCharacter(String character) {
        characters.add(character);
        System.out.println("👤 Added character: " + character);
    }

    public void listCharacters() {
        System.out.println("👥 Current characters: " + characters);
    }
}
```

---

## ItemManager (Singleton)

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ItemManager {
    private static ItemManager instance;
    private List<String> items = new ArrayList<>();

    private ItemManager() {}

    public static ItemManager getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new ItemManager();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public void addItem(String item) {
        items.add(item);
        System.out.println("📦 Added item: " + item);
    }

    public void listItems() {
        System.out.println("🎒 Current items: " + items);
    }
}
```

---

## Facade (GameFacade)

This facade makes it **easy** to use all managers without needing to touch them directly.

```java
public class GameFacade {
    private MusicManager musicManager = MusicManager.getInstance();
    private SoundEffectManager soundManager = SoundEffectManager.getInstance();
    private CharacterManager characterManager = CharacterManager.getInstance();
    private ItemManager itemManager = ItemManager.getInstance();

    public void startGame() {
        musicManager.playBackgroundTrack("escape_theme.mp3");
        characterManager.addCharacter("Player");
        itemManager.addItem("Flashlight");
        System.out.println("🚪 Escape Room started!");
    }

    public void solvePuzzle() {
        soundManager.playEffect("puzzle_solved.wav");
        itemManager.addItem("Key");
        System.out.println("✅ Puzzle solved! A key has been added to your inventory.");
    }

    public void endGame() {
        musicManager.stopMusic();
        soundManager.playEffect("victory_fanfare.wav");
        System.out.println("🏆 Game completed!");
        characterManager.listCharacters();
        itemManager.listItems();
    }
}
```

---

## Using the Facade in the Game

```java
public class EscapeRoomGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GameFacade game = new GameFacade();

        game.startGame();     // Starts background music, adds player and flashlight
        game.solvePuzzle();   // Plays puzzle sound, adds key
        game.endGame();       // Stops music, plays victory sound, shows summary
    }
}
```

---

## Sample Output

```java
🎵 Playing background music: escape_theme.mp3
👤 Added character: Player
📦 Added item: Flashlight
🚪 Escape Room started!
🔊 Playing sound effect: puzzle_solved.wav
📦 Added item: Key
✅ Puzzle solved! A key has been added to your inventory.
🛑 Music stopped.
🔊 Playing sound effect: victory_fanfare.wav
🏆 Game completed!
👥 Current characters: [Player]
🎒 Current items: [Flashlight, Key]
```

## Why This is Useful

- **Singleton Managers** ensure consistency (only one music system, one inventory, etc.).
    
- **Facade** provides a **clean, simple API** for the game — no need to call each manager separately.
    
- **Extensible**: If you add a `LightingManager` later, you just extend the Facade, not the game logic.
    

---

## Next Step Ideas 💡

- Add a **Pause/Resume** system in the facade (pause music, freeze characters).
    
- Combine with **Observer Pattern** so managers notify UI when things change.
    
- Use **Factory Pattern** to create items and characters inside the managers.

✅ **Key Takeaway:**  
By combining **Singleton Managers** with a **Facade**, you get **organized global systems** and a **simple interface** for controlling them — perfect for your escape room’s audio, characters, and items.
